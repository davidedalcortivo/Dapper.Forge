    /// This is a marker interface with no members. It is implemented by

    /// <see cref="Core.Models.FilterGroup{TEntity}"/>, which combines multiple nodes with a logical
    /// operator. Composing instances of these two types allows arbitrarily nested filter trees — equivalent to
    /// grouped <c>AND</c>/<c>OR</c> conditions — to be built and reused without constructing a LINQ expression tree.
    /// <para>
    /// Every query and command method that accepts a predicate also accepts an <see cref="IFilterNode{TEntity}"/> as
    /// an alternative, so filters can be assembled dynamically (for example, from user input) and passed directly
    /// to the library.
